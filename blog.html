                                <p style="text-align: center;">
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to thank the following speech-language bloggers for contributing to this article:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.activitytailor.com/blog/">Activity Tailor</a>, <a href="http://all4mychild.com/">All 4 My Child</a>, <a href="http://www.futureslps.com/blog.html">Future SLPs</a>, <a href="http://playonwords.com/">Play on Words</a>, <a href="http://speechladyliz.blogspot.com/">Speech Lady Liz</a>, and <a href="http://speechroomnews.blogspot.com/">Speech Room News</a>.</p>
                                <p>The number of Speech-Language Pathologists blogging and engaging in social media grew steadily in 2011. Those of us who are active on Twitter (we call ourselves the #SLPeeps), have been sharing articles and resources on blogs, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Recently though, the new social media kid on the block, <a href="../2012/01/13/fun-resource-for-therapy-ideas-pinterest/">Pinterest, has made it easier than ever for SLPs to engage each other and share ideas</a>. And with all the sharing going on, it has given bloggers a new place to network their ideas and find inspiration for new ones. While I am not sure exactly if there is causality, it seems that Pinterest is inspiring SLPs to jump into the blogging world. We have counted at least nine brand new SLP bloggers since the first of the year and all of them are also on Pinterest.</p>
                                <p>I was recently speaking with Maggie McGary, ASHA’s Social Media guru, and we started talking about how great it would be to survey Speech-Language bloggers and compile a short-list of ‘must follow blogs’ for both SLPs and their clients.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean Sweeney has compiled a great list of blogs in the <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F15492639829013772972%2Fbundle%2FSLP%20Blogs">SLP Blog Bundle</a>, but he doesn’t have a list of exactly who is in there, nor does he describe them anywhere one by one. So, since we have relationships with a great many of the regular speech and language bloggers already through our blog at PediaStaff, I mistakenly thought that I was well-suited for the job of compiling a ‘Best Blogs’ list. I emailed our contributors with a straw poll of sorts to get their votes for the best speech and language blogs in each of several areas. I waited patiently for results, and planned how I would deliver the findings to you in this column.</p>
                                <p>The results? Well…. The moral of this story is that there isn’t a short list! There are now a dizzying number of blogs to follow and most of them are definitely worth reading. What’s more, our respondents found it impossible to rank as “better” or “best” because they all have their own flavors and angles.</p>
                                <p>After the ‘best laid plans,’ fell through, what emerged was a list of the active blogs that were submitted as favorites, ordered from A to Z , plus some that are brand new that deserve notice.&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to make this list, the blogs needed to meet the following criteria:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>written by a speech-language pathologist or current graduate student</li>
                                    <li>currently active</li>
                                    <li>writes about (or shares resources on) speech language topics at least once a week (preferably more)</li>
                                    <li>directed to either clinicians, parents and caregivers</li>
                                    <li>has good ongoing continuity without multiple periods of inactivity in the past</li>
                                    <li>professional and well edited for spelling, grammar, etc</li>
                                    <li>shares more general resources and news than it does information on their own products or services</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>It is important to note that note that neither PediaStaff nor any of the contributors to this list specifically endorse any of these bloggers, nor make any claims to the clinical competence of the authors. In fact, a few of these bloggers keep their full names to themselves to protect their privacy, so we have no way of verifying if they are who they say they are. Please make your own informed decision as to the effectiveness/appropriateness of what these clinicians are sharing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this is by all means not a conclusive list (especially since new great new blogs seem to be popping up like daisies!) but as of&nbsp; March 2012, the following are the speech and language blogs that PediaStaff and our colleagues recommend that also meet the above criteria:</p>

                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to thank the following speech-language bloggers for contributing to this article:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.activitytailor.com/blog/">Activity Tailor</a>, <a href="http://all4mychild.com/">All 4 My Child</a>, <a href="http://www.futureslps.com/blog.html">Future SLPs</a>, <a href="http://playonwords.com/">Play on Words</a>, <a href="http://speechladyliz.blogspot.com/">Speech Lady Liz</a>, and <a href="http://speechroomnews.blogspot.com/">Speech Room News</a>.</p>
                                <p>The number of Speech-Language Pathologists blogging and engaging in social media grew steadily in 2011. Those of us who are active on Twitter (we call ourselves the #SLPeeps), have been sharing articles and resources on blogs, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. Recently though, the new social media kid on the block, <a href="../2012/01/13/fun-resource-for-therapy-ideas-pinterest/">Pinterest, has made it easier than ever for SLPs to engage each other and share ideas</a>. And with all the sharing going on, it has given bloggers a new place to network their ideas and find inspiration for new ones. While I am not sure exactly if there is causality, it seems that Pinterest is inspiring SLPs to jump into the blogging world. We have counted at least nine brand new SLP bloggers since the first of the year and all of them are also on Pinterest.</p>
                                <p>I was recently speaking with Maggie McGary, ASHA’s Social Media guru, and we started talking about how great it would be to survey Speech-Language bloggers and compile a short-list of ‘must follow blogs’ for both SLPs and their clients.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sean Sweeney has compiled a great list of blogs in the <a href="https://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F15492639829013772972%2Fbundle%2FSLP%20Blogs">SLP Blog Bundle</a>, but he doesn’t have a list of exactly who is in there, nor does he describe them anywhere one by one. So, since we have relationships with a great many of the regular speech and language bloggers already through our blog at PediaStaff, I mistakenly thought that I was well-suited for the job of compiling a ‘Best Blogs’ list. I emailed our contributors with a straw poll of sorts to get their votes for the best speech and language blogs in each of several areas. I waited patiently for results, and planned how I would deliver the findings to you in this column.</p>
                                <p>The results? Well…. The moral of this story is that there isn’t a short list! There are now a dizzying number of blogs to follow and most of them are definitely worth reading. What’s more, our respondents found it impossible to rank as “better” or “best” because they all have their own flavors and angles.</p>
                                <p>After the ‘best laid plans,’ fell through, what emerged was a list of the active blogs that were submitted as favorites, ordered from A to Z , plus some that are brand new that deserve notice.&nbsp; &nbsp;In order to make this list, the blogs needed to meet the following criteria:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>written by a speech-language pathologist or current graduate student</li>
                                    <li>currently active</li>
                                    <li>writes about (or shares resources on) speech language topics at least once a week (preferably more)</li>
                                    <li>directed to either clinicians, parents and caregivers</li>
                                    <li>has good ongoing continuity without multiple periods of inactivity in the past</li>
                                    <li>professional and well edited for spelling, grammar, etc</li>
                                    <li>shares more general resources and news than it does information on their own products or services</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>It is important to note that note that neither PediaStaff nor any of the contributors to this list specifically endorse any of these bloggers, nor make any claims to the clinical competence of the authors. In fact, a few of these bloggers keep their full names to themselves to protect their privacy, so we have no way of verifying if they are who they say they are. Please make your own informed decision as to the effectiveness/appropriateness of what these clinicians are sharing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this is by all means not a conclusive list (especially since new great new blogs seem to be popping up like daisies!) but as of&nbsp; March 2012, the following are the speech and language blogs that PediaStaff and our colleagues recommend that also meet the above criteria:</p>

                                <p>It is important to note that note that neither PediaStaff nor any of the contributors to this list specifically endorse any of these bloggers, nor make any claims to the clinical competence of the authors. In fact, a few of these bloggers keep their full names to themselves to protect their privacy, so we have no way of verifying if they are who they say they are. Please make your own informed decision as to the effectiveness/appropriateness of what these clinicians are sharing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this is by all means not a conclusive list (especially since new great new blogs seem to be popping up like daisies!) but as of&nbsp; March 2012, the following are the speech and language blogs that PediaStaff and our colleagues recommend that also meet the above criteria:</p>
